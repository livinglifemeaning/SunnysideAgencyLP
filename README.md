- I thought it was going to be easy! I was wrong. Just laying things out, figuring out the navbar, optimizing desktop, etc, took a long time. I still need to return to this project and figure out how I can have a unique hover for the social links without having a bunch of state that does the same thing. Also change the opacity on hover. The "onMouseEnter" and "onMouseExit" thing seems too much... Super proud of my parallax effect usage lol. 
- learned I can change svgs to JSX elements 
- knew that I needed to use useEffect when things were re-rendering too much, though still want to know when to use it before receiving an error
